It uses natural language processing to preprocess the text before it is analyzed. Topic modeling is then used to determine main features of the text, as well as extracting the languages and tools mentioned in the posting. The app also allows your job application files to be consistently labeled based on time/date and include details such as the company name so that all your files can be easily organized.',
